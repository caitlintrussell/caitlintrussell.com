Outside of the foundations curriculum, I worked on brushing up on my design knowledge, learning about all the new and great options with CSS3. WOW.

I've grown to love it, but in the beginning, I felt the same anxiety as when starting a new job, everyday. One spends almost as much time trying to figure out the other's working style as one does trying to solve the problems.

After that, we took an even deeper dive into the concept of Promises, working to replicate their functionality with our own classes. Very enlightening, very challenging. Thank you so much, ECMA, for fully integrating promises into ES6. I'm so grateful. We have our first timed checkpoint on Express and Sequelize tomorrow morning, as a benchmark test for everything we've learned thus far.
